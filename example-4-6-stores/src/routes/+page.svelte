<h1>Basic stores</h1>

<h2>Counter store</h2>
<p>
  The two components below each get their data from the same store, located in
  <code>lib/js/basic-stores.js</code>. Whenever we change the counter value, the counter display
  also changes.
</p>

<h3>Counter</h3>
<Counter />

<h3>Counter display</h3>
<CounterDisplay />

<h2>Derived store</h2>
<p>
  The component below gets its data from a <em>derived</em> store, which will automatically
  calculate the square of the counter store whenever the counter store is updated. The code for this
  store is also located in <code>lib/js/basic-stores.js</code>.
</p>

<SquareDisplay />

<h2>More stores!</h2>
<p>
  See if you can examine the source code and trace how the different components get and share their
  data.
